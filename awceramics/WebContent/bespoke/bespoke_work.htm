<p class="lead">Generally I come to you and spend a day taking photographs of whatever seems appropriate and inspiring, following discussions between us. I will take literally hundreds of photographs &ndash; as it can be the most unprepossessing thing that finally works best. I then present you with fired pieces using the imagery I feel works best. I work with the images to bring out their inherent drama. Often I work in black and white but sometimes I work in colour if it seems to best suit the image.
</p>
<p class="lead">I can also work with your photography &ndash; and you can always send me some shots for me to have a look at. Do remember that the copyright for a photograph resides with the photographer unless they have signed over these rights to you. If they haven&rsquo;t you will need to seek their permission and possibly pay a fee for the additional use of the image. 
</p>
<p class="lead">Sometimes what works best is a combination of the two.
</p>
<p class="lead">I ask you to cover my transport costs for coming to you.  I also ask for a deposit of Â£200 beforehand which is offset against your first order which must be for 50 pieces.
</p>
<p class="lead">I develop a range of cufflinks or cufflinks, pendants, earrings and brooches according to your requirements.
</p>
<p class="lead">
I retain the copyright of all photography that I have originated. I will not however sell pieces bearing these images either direct to the public or to other shops or galleries as long as you are stocking them. Once a year has elapsed without a top up order (minimum 25 pieces) being placed I reserve the right to use the images myself.
Please feel free to call me on 07880 520071 to discuss any requirements you may have or email on <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>: <a href="mailto:enquiries@awceramics.co.uk">enquiries@awceramics.co.uk</a>
