<div class="lead">For those of you who read my last blog about going on retreat, I feel I owe you a short follow up to let you know how it was! St Winifred&rsquo;s Well was a delightful spot: quiet, solitary but not far from civilisation, filled with birdsong, and rather wet -but I hadn&rsquo;t realised just how close to Wales it was! Inside it was simple and comfortable.<br>

<br>
I didn&rsquo;t summon up the pain addicted redneck zombies, or any other kind, and was in glorious solitude for the entire week. There was a footpath that went past a few feet from my door but in a week I only saw one person go by.<br>
<br>
I decided that what I was seeking was solitude not silence so when out on walks I happily engaged with anyone I met who seemed inclined to talk. But this constituted a small part of my week and the majority was simply spent being. Of course every day there were highlights: breakfast, or indeed any meal, ukulele practise, playing with inks (see masterpiece included here), but there was a great deal of just sitting around and meditating.<br>
<br>

<br>
I did read the first half of Simon Parke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Solitude&rdquo; which I have read before, and it was the perfect book to read and the only one I needed. It also would remind me to put the book down and just be . . . which I sometimes did with reluctance as reading about being is so much easier than just being.<br>
<br>
The end result was a beautiful solitary peaceful week, with occasional moments of boredom, and one big craving for dancing, which I resisted &ndash; probably just as well as I looked like Mrs Wurzel Gummidge and would have had to go to the ball in either slippers or walking boots!<br>
<br>

<br>
I thought I would miss Facebook, emails and my mobile but was pleased that I didn&rsquo;t.<br>
<br>
By the end of the week I was very keen to come back to London and my fun filled busy life, and of course catch up on the Tour (de France). It is lovely to be back but I do hope to go again next year as it is a powerfully beautiful experience being alone.<br>
<br>
PS. Felt my ukulele playing had really come along but when I get together with Lydia my teacher I was rubbish! It&rsquo;s all about the journey though, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
