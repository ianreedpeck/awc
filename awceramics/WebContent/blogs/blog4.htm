Eadwierd Muybridge:</li></ol>
<h1 id="header">Eadwierd Muybridge:</h1>
<div class="lead">Bespoke Work &ndash; Eadwierd Muybridge and others<br>
<br>
Because my work involves the use of photographic images it has always had the potential for bespoke work but it is only in the last six months that I have begun to explore this. The impetus came from the British Museum. They saw my work at the trade show Top Drawer and loved the idea of a range of cufflinks based on the architecture of the building and the collection. Many other museums and individuals had expressed interest before but the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org" target="_blank">British Museum</a> wanted to me to design a range of cufflinks in time for Christmas.<br>
<br>
I took my camera along to the museum and set about trying to photograph the magnificent roof of the Great Court. I took about 20 images of the roof and then wandered around the Egyptian gallery in search of inspiration. The thing with the British Museum is that it truly is inspiring &ndash; visually, anthropologically &ndash; and any way you look at it.<br>
<br>
The hard work for me (but also perhaps the most fun part) comes afterwards when I start to look at and play with the images on screen. My initial reaction is always that it doesn&rsquo;t add up to much, won&rsquo;t work, won&rsquo;t yield anything worthwhile. I discovered that by staying with it, printing things off, considering things over a day or two and then revisiting the images that gradually things come together. Then I fell in love with my own work &ndash; suddenly I&rsquo;m happy and all is well with the world! Fortunately the people at the British museum also liked what I&rsquo;d done &ndash; and that was the start of what has been to date a very happy relationship. My confidence boosted by this experience, when I was approached by <a href="http://www.kingston.gov.uk/museum" target="_blank">Kingston museums</a> to do some work based around the imagery of Eadwierd Muybridge I didn&rsquo;t hesitate. I remember coming across a book of images by Eadwierd Muybridge in the library when I was studying at Camberwell &ndash; fascinating! Not only visually amazing but so obviously the work of a man obsessed &ndash; and how did get so many people to take their clothes for him??<br>
<br>
Finally I have also done some work of late for Museums Sheffield. How to capture the essence of a city in a series of tiny images? Sheffield is quite a pleasant place to visit &ndash; though I was unlucky with the weather the day I went &ndash; but it has a nice feeling about it and I can imagine it is a very nice place to live. I have been through the trauma of working with the photographs I took, I have crossed the raging torrent and reached the calm safety of the other side and am happy with what I have done. I hope very much that Museums Sheffield like it too &ndash; the next couple of weeks will reveal all!<br>
<br>
So do I hope to do more bespoke work in the future &ndash; you bet!! &ndash; even though it is always a challenge &ndash; will I rise to the occasion &ndash; will it work? Still it&rsquo;s good to challenge yourself &ndash; n&rsquo;est-ce pas?<br>
