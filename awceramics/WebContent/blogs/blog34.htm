I loved Oxford &ndash; well there seems to be so much to love about it! Ok so I was lucky with the weather and that always helps, but it really is a lovely laid back sort of place! I was on a mission to photograph and create Iconic Oxford &ndash; ideally in time for the Pulse trade show which I am taking part in, in early June. I did a bit of research beforehand (I am a pro after all!) and with street map printed from the internet, two cameras and sundry batteries and memory cards off I went.<br>
<br>
Things did not get off to a glorious start. I made a mistake paying for my parking. I needed six hours which cost �13.30 (it&rsquo;s good to dissuade car use so I was ok with that) but I accidently only put in �13 so I only got four hours!!!! I then had to return to the car park after four hours and pay a further �5.20 for the next two hours! An expensive lesson was absorbed &ndash; don&rsquo;t be such a thicky Allison!<br>
<br>
But it was a beautiful day, I was in a place completely unknown to me and so off I set!<br>
<br>
The first nice thing about Oxford that became evident was its size. It is such a very manageable city. You can get to most places on foot in about twenty minutes. The second thing to strike me was the absence of cars. It&rsquo;s the kind of place where you can wander about, stepping off into the road willy nilly without fearing for your life &ndash; handy if you are trying to take photographs and often either looking up or through a lens. The third thing is there are loads of people on bikes &ndash; which always makes me very happy! They are doing something that is good for their health as well as being good for everyone else&rsquo;s too! And last but by no means least are the beautiful beautiful buildings! And Oxford is just full of them! The Sheridan Theatre, <a href="http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley" target="_blank">the Radcliffe Camera, the Bodleian Library,</a> the churches, the colleges . . . . you can&rsquo;t move for fine architectural examples. It must be a real privilege to study in a place like Oxford &ndash; but I suppose that is very much a fifty something take on the world, eighteen year olds probably don&rsquo;t look at it that way &ndash; and I wouldn&rsquo;t have when I was eighteen I&rsquo;m sure!<br>

Highlights of my trip included a stroll to south Park which affords a lovely view back over the city, a stroll by the canal, and the visit to Christ church college &ndash; just wonderful! Oh yes and stumbling across the shop (not open of course &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t need to be) for (not about) the fictional characters of Oxford! Insane and wonderful.<br>
<br>
Beautiful, beautiful Oxford . . . . your spires did make me dream.<br>
