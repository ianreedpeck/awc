Exhaustion &ndash; but it&rsquo;s good really . . .</li></ol>
<h1 id="header">Exhaustion &ndash; but it&rsquo;s good really . . .</h1>
<div class="lead">Trade shows are always exhausting and Pulse 2010 was no exception. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you set up on Saturday, work Sunday, Monday and Tuesday and then just carry on &ndash; losing that precious downtime of the weekend. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just because shows always involve a lot of getting up early, standing around all day then getting home late! But at least this Pulse can be considered a success with a lot of interest and orders from clients new and old. The proximity of Father&rsquo;s Day meant that some orders had to be got out quickly so I couldn&rsquo;t allow myself the customary day off afterwards. It was straight down the studio and to work! What was gratifying was that my new &ldquo;Classic Vehicles&rdquo; range was very well received and figures on<br>
<br>

<br>
most of the orders I took &ndash; hurrah! I like it very much but then like most designers I am always most in love with my latest creation, and bored by my early work (London Wired range) &ndash; which people seeing it for the first time really love! Designer makers inevitably get bored of their own work way before anyone else because we look at it too often and can fail to see its beauty any more. That&rsquo;s why it is so lovely when someone approaches you work with fresh eyes and tells you how much they love it!<br>
<br>
So I&rsquo;ve been working like a Trojan for the last week and several orders have been despatched. Today my new assistant Mel joined me - <a href="http://www.melisadora.com" target="_blank">www.melisadora.com</a>. She is in the process of graduating from Brighton university and will do one or two days a week for me. She worked hard today and as a trained ceramist was able to hit the ground running. I was very happy, and she seems a delightful person to boot.<br>
<br>
On Friday we will transform my room for the open studio. The room will get its six monthly hoover and mopping, and will become a beautiful showcase for my work. And I will take Monday off &ndash; come what may &ndash; I think I deserve it!<br>
