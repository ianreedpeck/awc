<h1 id="header">Going On Retreat</h1>
<br>
<div class="lead">I have been on retreat several times but always on something organised with other people. But this time it is different: I am going alone to spend 8 days in silence. This is not a whim &ndash; it is something I have considered and wanted to do for quite a long time.<br>
<br>
And now the day of my departure is imminent &ndash; I leave tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I am staying in a lovely tiny cottage in a wood somewhere in Shropshire (I have confidence in the sat nav), it has most modern comforts with the exception of the bathroom being down the end of a path. But of course this trip isn&rsquo;t really about comfort. Nor however is it about me donning a hair shirt. Originally I did think I would detox when I was there but have subsequently decided that I shouldn&rsquo;t make things harder than they need to be. So for the most part food will be as normal with the omission of alcohol &ndash; for which I&rsquo;m sure my system will be very grateful!<br>
<br>
This retreat is however about journeying within and therefore I am keeping potential distractions to a minimum. I will take three spiritual books (one of them Simon Parke&rsquo;s wonderful &ldquo;Solitude&rdquo; &ndash; as nothing could be more apt! I will take my ukulele as I need the practise, a notebook for recording my thoughts and feelings, two guided meditations, and some art materials. Is the latter cheating? I don&rsquo;t think so. Art is a wonderful way of getting in touch with yourself and expressing something that you feel but that may be beyond words or just impossible to comprehend through intellectual thought &ndash; oh how that limits us sometimes.<br>

<br>
So with some trepidation but also with a smile and a sense of adventure I will set off to my "cabin in the woods" &ndash; making sure I don&rsquo;t summon up the pain addicted rednecks (if by any chance you have seen the film), and without ever ever going into the cellar! The only real downside to all this is the timing &ndash; I will be missing the first week of the Tour De France which I have loved watching every year for the last 21 years! Still there will still be almost 2 full weeks to go when I get back! Go Cav, go Brad!<br>
