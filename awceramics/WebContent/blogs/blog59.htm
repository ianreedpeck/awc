<h1 id="header">The Amy Winehouse Exhibition</h1>
<br>
<div class="lead">It took me three attempts to get to see this exhibition! The first time I was thwarted by lack of time. The second time it was a Friday afternoon and the museum is shut on a Friday afternoon - doh! And the third time I did actually make it. However, the northern line was shut which didn't make things so easy - plus the cafe is shut on a Saturday so having got there had to leave immediately in search of sustenance.<br>
<br>
Finally, fed and in the right place, I went up to the 3rd floor to find out about Amy. It&rsquo;s a single room and a small intimate exhibitiion. Lots of family photos, bits and bobs that Amy collected, a few dresses, CDs etc. From it emerges a picture of a surprisingly petite young woman with a big personality, a big voice and a big need to succeed. She seems to have come from a loving and supportive family - what a shame that just wasn&rsquo;t enough to ensure her survival beyond the tender age of 27.<br>
<br>
So while I was there I thought I might as well check out the rest of the museum. I liked it very much. The second floor deals with immigration, life in the East End , and the holocaust. This section is of course very sad. Too sad to even begin to describe. No matter how many films or documentaries you see, however many times you hear the story, it is still powerfully moving and tragic.<br>
<br>
On the first floor are lots of artefacts relating to the Jewish faith. There are short videos explaining about circumcision, the Sabbath, the wedding ceremony etc. They are nicely done and give you a feeling for the importance of family life in the Jewish community. The video says that a Jewish man is not complete until he finds a wife... and while I don't agree with this sentiment, it still makes me smile.<br>
<br>
I think the <a href="http://www.jewishmuseum.org.uk/" target="_blank">Jewish Museum</a> does a very good job of explaining what it means to be Jewish and gives a very nice insight into the religion and the lives of those that practise it. A nice museum with or without Amy - God rest her soul.<br>
