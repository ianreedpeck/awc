Discovering Yorkshire: Part 1 - Hawes</li></ol>
<h1 id="header">Discovering Yorkshire: Part 1 - Hawes</h1>
<br>
<div class="lead">We live at the bottom of the dales in Gargrave, just outside of Skipton, and on the Pennine Way.  We are keen to explore the whole of the dales and have started at the top in:<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hawes</span><br><br>
Hawes is a beautiful  small market town in the north of the dales at the head of Wensleydale (and yes they do make the cheese there).  We decided first to do a circular walk from the town , a nice easy 2-3 hour stroll to Hardraw Force and back.  Hardraw Force, England's longest single drop waterfall is on the land of the Green Dragon pub so you have to go into the pub and pay Â£2.50 to see it.  It is worth it though, as it is a very pleasant 5 minute stroll along well maintained paths and it is a lovely spot. You probably wouldn't want to do it every year but it is probably worth shelling out every 5 or 10 - depending on how much you like waterfalls. The pub itself is very nice with a roaring fire in the main bar, and a stone flagged floor, but we were keen to carry on walking so we did not tarry.<br><br>

<br><br>
The second part of the walk was beautiful with fine views across the dale.  I have included a picture of two sheep whose proximity to one another demonstates very well how breeds are very different from one another.  The sheep lying down is a Black Faced Swaledale - easily recognised because it looks like its black face has been dipped in milk.  A very tough breed you will see it in high up inhospitable landscapes, whereas its companion is a Leicester Blue.  This has a more delicate constitution and needs gentler conditions and more looking after but it seems that the meat resulting from their joint offspring is particularly tender and delicious.  So farmers breed both.

Back in Hawes we had a wander round, a cup of tea and lamented the fact that we would be missing the local talent competition - we will be in Deptford, London for the Cockpit Open Studios - shame as I'm sure it will be great.
