<h1 id="header">Leaving Cockpit Arts</h1>
<br>
<div class="lead">Well with only my kiln left in the room my space at Cockpit looks enormous! Everyone asks me if I will miss Cockpit and the answer is yes and no. I have moved on, fully embraced the Yorkshire experience, and am looking forward to the next phase of my life, as a person and as a maker.  There are, and have been, over the 13 plus years I�ve been there, many lovely people, but modern technology makes it easier to stay in touch these days, and well nothing lasts forever. <br><br>
I can say with no equivocation that I have loved my time at <a href="http://www.cockpitarts.com/" target="_blank">Cockpit Arts</a>.  It is not only that it is full of wonderful, inspiring and inspired people, it is also very well run.  The Open Studios are very well run, there is great support and many opportunities for the makers.  When I joined I was still at college, but keen to get into the big outside world and see what kind of reception my work would get.  I received what was then called a "seedbed award" which gave me a space initially at half price, gradually going up to full price over a three year period.  Now people early in their career generally get an award that gives them a free space for a year.  This systems are hugely helpful to people starting out in their creative careers, giving them a little time and breathing space to refine their product offering, and understand how to get out there and start selling.
<br><br>
More experienced makers, particularly <a href="http://www.lushlampshades.co.uk/" target="_blank">Lush Designs</a> were very helpful to me in my early days.  I remember Marie saying to me "make something people want to buy".
<br><br>
I remember my first trade shows and again the help I got from other makers with order forms etc. 
<br><br>
The first time anyone wants to buy something you have made is very exciting!! In my first Open Studios I was selling pieces that I had made in my second year at Camberwell.
<br><br>
And so my little business grew. My product became more refined, more recognisable.  I developed a following for my particular style of work, my confidence grew, and I started doing bespoke work for museums.
<br><br>
And now I have come to the end of that furrow.  I still intend to make my jewellery, particularly my cufflinks for which I am best known, but I also intend to return to my roots. My first love in ceramics was throwing.  So this summer tucked away in my "luxury" shed in my beautiful garden I intend to do just that.
<br><br>
It�s both exciting and nerve wracking (though not as bad as being in the Pottery Throwdown!), and I have no idea what will come out of it.
<br><br>
If you would like to see what evolves over the next few years, then please feel free to follow me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Allison-Wiffen-Ceramics/129219650421914?ref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/allisonwiffen" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or even come by when you are next in North Yorkshire (address).
<br><br>
And well you never know you might see me at the Cockpit Open Studios along with the other alumni.
