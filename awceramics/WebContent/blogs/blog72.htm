<h1 id="header">Art in the Pen and Crafts in the Pen</h1>
<br>
<div class="lead">This year I took part in both these events (<a href="https://www.artinthepen.org.uk/skipton" title="Art in the Pen" target="_blank">Art in the Pen</a> and <a href="https://www.craftsinthepen.org.uk/" title="Crafts in the Pen" target="_blank">Crafts in the Pen</a>) with a reasonable degree of financial success on both occasions.  I am now applying to do both shows again this year and crossing my fingers that my work fits the bill.  These are both local events for me - just 5 miles away in Skipton which does make the whole process of setting up and manning the stand considerably easier.  I have taken the bold decision to apply for a double sized stand at both.  Will this result in twice as many sales, I doubt it, but it will ensure that I don't get missed which in quite a big show is easily done.  The pens are deeper than they are wide which sometimes makes people unwilling to commit themselves and enter the narrow confines of the stand.  So they browse from a distance and often perhaps don't see the one piece which they would love. 
<br><br>



I do accept that not everyone will like my work, and many a person will just glance and walk by but I will feel happier that I have done my very best to get my work seen.  It's a bit like making sure that your shop has a good shop window and a well stocked and  well laid out interior.  Ultimately people might not buy from you but it will not be because they didn't notice you work.

So if you want to see if my strategy worked, look out for a blog in August celebrating or lamenting my decision.
